function y=winsorising(varargin)
% Winsorising extreme values.
% Winsorising or Winsorization is the transformation of statistics by
% limiting extreme values in the statistical data to reduce the effect of
% possibly spurious outliers. It is named after the engineer-turned-biostatistician 
% Charles P. Winsor (1895â€“1951). The effect is the same as clipping in 
% signal processing. The distribution of many statistics can be heavily 
% influenced by outliers. A typical strategy is to set all outliers to a
% specified percentile of the data; for example, a 90% Winsorisation would
% see all data below the 5th percentile set to the 5th percentile, and data
% above the 95th percentile set to the 95th percentile. Winsorised
% estimators are usually more robust to outliers than their more standard
% forms, although there are alternatives, such as trimming, that will
% achieve a similar effect. Note that Winsorizing is not equivalent to
% simply excluding data, which is a simpler procedure, called trimming. 
% In a trimmed estimator, the extreme values are discarded; in a Winsorized
% estimator, the extreme values are instead replaced by certain percentiles
% (the trimmed minimum and maximum).  
% Thus a Winsorized mean is not the same as a truncated mean. For instance,
% the 5% trimmed mean is the average of the 5th to 95th percentile of the
% data, while the 90% Winsorised mean sets the bottom 5% to the 5th
% percentile, the top 5% to the 95th percentile, and then averages the data

% Syntax: 	Y=winsorising(X,W)
%           X - data matrix or vector
%           For vectors, WINSORISING(X) is the winsorized X array. 
%           For matrices, WINSORISING(X) is a matrix containing the 
%           winsorized element from each column. 
%
%           W - Amount of winsoritazion (90 by default). If you set W=90 this 
%           means that the remaing 10% (0-5th percentile and 95-100th
%           percentile) will be substituted.
%
%      Example: 
%
% x=[92 19 101 58 103 91 26 78 10 13 0 101 86 85 15 89 89 25 2 41];
%
%           Calling on Matlab the function: winsorizing(x)
%
%           Answer is:
%
% y=92 19 101 58 102 91 26 78 10 13 1 101 86 85 15 89 89 25 2 41
